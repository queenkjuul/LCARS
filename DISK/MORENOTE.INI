QUEEN K JUUL's LCARS 7.10 UTILITY
=================================

Lots of 
Convenient
Accessories for
Retro
Systems

Based on "MS-DOS 7.10," the custom repack of 9x DOS by the China DOS Union

Designed to be able to install Windows 9x on a machine with USB ports but 
no functional CDROM, though I imagine it could be useful in other situations. 

___________________
-------------------

This is very much DOS for "modern" machines (Pentium and above). No 
consideration was given to memory conservation, and the included utilities are 
only really useful if you have big storage, USB drives, and existing Windows 
installations. It presumes that EMS and XMS are available, and it works best 
when installed to RAM.

My original use case was a Pentium 233 laptop with a dead CDROM, but working
FDD and USB ports. Win95 ISO goes on the USB, mount it as virtual CDROM, 
copy the contents to HDD, run Setup from there. Remarkably, ALL the utilities
I find essential to a modern DOS getup-zip tools, shsucd/shsufd, LFN, NTFS, etc
fit on a single 1.44--which I honestly found very surprising. 
(and a few KB to spare!!)

________
FEATURES
--------

[USB] - Out of the box, the system will scan for USB flash drives and CDROM
     drives. Tested working with a PNY 8GB USB stick and a modern ASUS USB 2.0
     CD/DVD combo drive. Should work without much configuration, but can be 
     extremely picky about hardware (I'm about 50/50 on my whether or not a
     flash drive from my stock will work)

[VIRTUAL DISKS] - SHSUCDX/SHSUFDRV are included, which are virtual disk (CD/FD)
     drivers for DOS. Mount ISOs and IMGs effortlessly. Details below. 

[NIXINESS] - `ls` can be run in place of `dir /o /w'. DOSKEY and MORE installed
     for tab completion, command history, and useable output. 
     MORE is also aliased to LESS

[CDROM] - Includes VIDE-CDD.SYS and is compatible with USB CDROM drives

[DOSLFN] - DOS / Win9x Long Filename support

[FAT32] - FAT32 disk support (even on USB!)

[NTFS] - Read-only NTFS disk support (even on USB!)

[HIMEM / EMM386] - Configured out of the box for high memory support to 
    enable RAMDISKS or CD-ROM software

[CTMOUSE] - FreeDOS mouse drivers included


____________
INSTALLATION
------------

Grab the `LCARS-v7.10_latest.img` file from the repo, and write it to a 
floppy with `dd` in linux, I have not tested it with any DOS/Windows tools.

Alternatively, take a Windows 98 boot floppy, and copy all the contents of the
DISK directory over to the floppy, overwriting everything else. 

_______
BOOTING
-------

At boot, you are presented with two options: FULL or FAST

FULL loads USB drivers (flash drives or optical drives [yes, even modern ones])
also loads IDE CDROM drivers, and copies entire disk to RAM for faster 
operation (however, this takes much much longer to boot, as the USB scanning 
takes time and the RAM copy process can take up to a couple minutes)
Of course, once the OS is in RAM, the floppy can be removed.

FAST loads just the essentials--no CDROM, no USB, no copy to RAM, but otherwise
contains the entire rest of the system including mouse drivers, etc.

If you choose FAST, you can manually install to RAM by running

    RAMSTALL

After running RAMSTALL, use Z: in place of A:
___________
QUICK NOTES
-----------

You can run the following commands for some basic help:

    NOTES       // view disk image mounting commands
    MORENOTE    // view this README

_________
UTILITIES
---------

---------------------------------------

[SHSUCD] - Virtual CDROM Device Manager
---------------------------------------

    Mounts a CDROM image (ISO, BIN) to the next available drive letter. For 
    your convenience, a frontend script is provided to simplify mounting, 
    though full features are installed 
    (see http://adoxa.altervista.org/shsucdx/index.html)

    USAGE:  mount <PATH_TO_IMAGE>       // mounts disk to next available letter
            umount                      //unmounts all mounted image files

[USBASPI] - Universal USB Drivers for DOS
-----------------------------------------

    Installed to CONFIG.SYS. Scans USB controllers on boot, and mounts any 
    detected FAT32 USB Mass Storage devices. Can be picky about drives. 
    MBR only, FAT16 or FAT32 only. Anecdotally, it's best to have your 
    drive freshly formatted on a Windows machine 
    (Linux partition + format tools don't always work). 

    IT IS SERIOUSLY PICKY ABOUT DRIVES. NOTHING I CAN DO. KEEP TRYING TO 
    REFORMAT/KEEP PARTITIONS UNDER 2GB/ETC. USB CD DRIVES WORK *SOMETIMES*

[PKZIP / PKUNZIP] - ZIP Codec
-----------------------------

    Classic and self-explanatory. Baked right in. 

[XMSDISK] - RAM Disk 
--------------------

    Creates virtual disk drives in memory. 

        XMSDSK <SIZE_IN_MB> <DRIVELETTER>: /Y   // creates new disk in ram
        XMSDSK 2048 Z: /Y                       // example. creates 2MB ramdisk

    

[VC] - Volkov Commander
-----------------------

    Includes Volkov Commander, the excellent two-pane file manager for DOS. 
    Invoke it with 

        vc

[CHKDSK] - DOS Disk Check Utility
[SCANDISK] - Windows 95 Disk Check Utility
[FORMAT] - Disk Format Utility
