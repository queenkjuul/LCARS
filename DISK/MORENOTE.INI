QUEEN K JUUL's LCARS 7.10 UTILITY
=================================

Lots of
Convenient
Accessories for
Retro
Systems

Based on "MS-DOS 7.10," the custom repack of 9x DOS by the China DOS Union

Designed to be able to install Windows 9x on a machine with USB ports but
no functional CDROM, though I imagine it could be useful in other situations.

___________________
-------------------

This is very much DOS for "modern" machines (Pentium and above). No
consideration was given to memory conservation, and the included utilities are
only really useful if you have big storage, USB drives, and existing Windows
installations. It presumes that EMS and XMS are available, and it works best
when installed to RAM.

My original use case was a Pentium 233 laptop with a dead CDROM, but working
FDD and USB ports. Win95 ISO goes on the USB, mount it as virtual CDROM,
copy the contents to HDD, run Setup from there. Remarkably, ALL the utilities
I find essential to a modern DOS getup-zip tools, shsucd/shsufd, LFN, NTFS, etc
fit on a single 1.44--which I honestly found very surprising.
(and a few KB to spare!!)

FEATURES
--------

[USB] - Out of the box, the system will scan for USB flash drives and CDROM
     drives. Tested working with a PNY 8GB USB stick and a modern ASUS USB 2.0
     CD/DVD combo drive. Should work without much configuration, but can be
     extremely picky about hardware (I'm about 50/50 on my whether or not a
     flash drive from my stock will work)

[VIRTUAL DISKS] - SHSUCDX/SHSUFDRV are included, which are virtual disk (CD/FD)
     drivers for DOS. Mount ISOs and IMGs effortlessly. Details below.

[DISK IMAGING] - `snatch` can create IMG files from floppies. These IMG files
     are compatible with SHSUFDRV above. When system is installed to RAM,
     you can eject the LCARS disk and back up floppies to HDD/USB

[NIXINESS] - `ls` invokes `h.com` which is the app HotDIR, which gives
     colorful, paginated output.
     `more` can be invoked with `less`.
     `rm.com` provides nearly-identical syntax as UNIX `rm`.
     `grep` provides nearly-identical syntax as UNIX `grep`.
     DOSKEY provides command history and tab completion.

[CDROM] - Includes VIDE-CDD.SYS and is compatible with USB CDROM drives

[DOSLFN] - DOS / Win9x Long Filename support

[FAT32] - FAT32 disk support (even on USB!)

[NTFS] - Read-only NTFS disk support (even on USB!)

[HIMEM / EMM386] - Configured out of the box for high memory support to
    enable RAMDISKS or CD-ROM software

[CTMOUSE] - FreeDOS mouse drivers included

____________

INSTALLATION
------------

Grab the `LCARS-v7.10_latest.img` file from the repo, and write it to a
floppy with `dd` in linux, I have not tested it with any DOS/Windows tools.

Alternatively, take a Windows 98 boot floppy, and copy all the contents of the
DISK directory over to the floppy, overwriting everything else.

_______

BOOTING
-------

At boot, you are presented with two options: FULL or FAST

FULL loads USB drivers (flash drives or optical drives [yes, even modern ones])
also loads IDE CDROM drivers, and copies entire disk to RAM for faster
operation (however, this takes much much longer to boot, as the USB scanning
takes time and the RAM copy process can take up to a couple minutes)
Of course, once the OS is in RAM, the floppy can be removed.

FAST loads just the essentials--no CDROM, no USB, no copy to RAM, but otherwise
contains the entire rest of the system including mouse drivers, etc.

If you choose FAST, you can manually install to RAM by running

    RAMSTALL

After running RAMSTALL, use Z: in place of A:

QUICK NOTES
-----------

You can run the following commands for some basic help:

    NOTES       // view disk image mounting commands
    MORENOTE    // view this README

UTILITIES
---------

---------------------------------------

[SHSUCD] - Virtual CDROM Device Manager
[SHSUFD] - Virtual Floppy Disk Manager
---------------------------------------

    Mounts a CDROM image (ISO, BIN) or floppy image (IMG) to the next 
    available drive letter. For your convenience, a frontend script is 
    provided to simplify mounting, though full features are installed 
    (see http://adoxa.altervista.org/shsucdx/index.html)
    (see http://adoxa.altervista.org/shsufdrv/index.html)

    USAGE:  mount <PATH_TO_IMAGE>       // mounts disk to next available letter
            umount                      // unmounts all mounted image files
            fmount <PATH_TO_IMAGE>      // mounts floppy disk IMG file
            fmount -u                   // unmounts mounted floppy IMGs

[USBASPI] - Universal USB Drivers for DOS
-----------------------------------------

    Installed to CONFIG.SYS. Scans USB controllers on boot, and mounts any 
    detected FAT32 USB Mass Storage devices. Can be picky about drives. 
    MBR only, FAT16 or FAT32 only. Anecdotally, it's best to have your 
    drive freshly formatted on a Windows machine 
    (Linux partition + format tools don't always work). 

    IT IS SERIOUSLY PICKY ABOUT DRIVES. NOTHING I CAN DO. KEEP TRYING TO 
    REFORMAT/KEEP PARTITIONS UNDER 2GB/ETC. USB CD DRIVES WORK *SOMETIMES*

[PKZIP / PKUNZIP] - ZIP Codec
-----------------------------

    Classic and self-explanatory. Baked right in. 

[XMSDISK] - RAM Disk
--------------------

    Creates virtual disk drives in memory. 

        XMSDSK <SIZE_IN_MB> <DRIVELETTER>: /Y   // creates new disk in ram
        XMSDSK 2048 Z: /Y                       // example. creates 2MB ramdisk

[VC] - Volkov Commander
-----------------------

    Includes Volkov Commander, the excellent two-pane file manager for DOS. 
    Invoke it with 

        vc

[SCANDISK] - Windows 95 Disk Check Utility
[FORMAT] - Disk Format Utility
[FDISK] - Disk Partition Utility
[XCOPY] - Bulk Copy / Backup Utility
----------------------------

    Classic DOS Disk Utilities, included. 

[EDIT.COM] - Text Editor
------------------------

    Classic DOS text editor, included. 

[SNATCH] - Floppy Disk Imaging Utility
--------------------------------------

    Creates IMG files from floppy disks, and can write IMG files back to 
    floppy disks. 

        SNATCH DRIVE: [-W] [-P FILENAME]

            -W      Write image to specified drive
                    Will only read DISKETTE.IMG from 
                    current directory. Cannot specify 
                    filename manually in write mode.

            -P      Output image to specified file 
                    Default DISKETTE.IMG if not specified

[LS]
[RM]
[GREP]
[LESS]
[REBOOT] - UNIX-style Commands
------------------------------

    `ls` invokes HOTDIR 2.0, a DIR replacement with colorful output,
    sorting features, pagination, and more. Switches and output are not
    similar to UNIX `ls`, but force of habit and all that. 

    `rm`, `grep`, and `less` work more or less the same as their UNIX
    counterparts and have built-in help functions.
    `DELTREE` is not included in newer images as `rm` provides
    better functionality. 

    `reboot` will by default bring up a menu to select your reboot type,
    `reboot 1` will immediately perform a default reboot.
