QUEEN K JUUL's LCARS 7.10 UTILITY
=================================

Lots of 
Convenient
Accessories for
Retro
Systems

Based on "MS-DOS 7.10," the custom repack of 9x DOS by the China DOS Union

Designed to be able to install Windows 9x on a machine with USB ports but 
no functional CDROM, though I imagine it could be useful in other situations. 

___________________
-------------------

This is very much DOS for "modern" machines (Pentium and above). No 
consideration was given to memory conservation, and the included utilities are 
only really useful if you have storage large enough to handle collections of 
disk images, USB accessories, and existing Windows installations. It presumes
that EMS and XMS are available, and it works best when installed to a RAMdrive.

My original use case was a Pentium 233 laptop with a dead CDROM, but working
FDD and USB ports. Win95 ISO goes on the USB, mount it as virtual CDROM, 
copy the contents to HDD, run Setup from there. Remarkably, ALL the utilities
I find essential to a modern DOS getup-zip tools, shsucd/shsufd, LFN, NTFS, etc
fit on a single 1.44--which I honestly found very surprising. 
(and a few KB to spare!!)

____________
INSTALLATION
------------

Grab the `LCARS-v7.10_latest.img` file from the repo, and write it to a 
floppy with `dd` in linux, I have not tested it with any DOS/Windows tools.

Alternatively, take a Windows 98 boot floppy, and copy all the contents of the
DISK directory over to the floppy, overwriting everything else. 

_______
BOOTING
-------

At boot, you are presented with two options: FULL or FAST

FULL loads USB drivers (flash drives or optical drives [yes, even modern ones])
also loads CDROM drivers, and copies entire disk to RAM for faster operation
(however, this takes much much longer to boot, as the USB scanning takes time
and the RAM copy process can take up to a couple minutes)
Of course, once the OS is in RAM, the floppy can be removed.

FAST loads just the essentials--no CDROM, no USB, no copy to RAM, but otherwise
contains the entire rest of the system including mouse drivers, etc.

If you choose FAST, you can manually install to RAM by running

    RAMSTALL

When the system is installed to RAM, use Z: in place of A:

QUICK NOTES
-----------

You can run the following commands for some basic help:

    NOTES       // view disk image mounting commands
    MORENOTE    // view this README
    SHSUCDX     // MSCDEX is not included. SHSUCDX uses same command syntax

UTILITIES
---------

---------------------------------------

[SHSUCD] - Virtual CDROM Device Manager
---------------------------------------

    Mounts a CDROM image (ISO, BIN) to the next available drive letter. For 
    your convenience, a frontend script is provided to simplify mounting, 
    though full features are installed 
    (see http://adoxa.altervista.org/shsucdx/index.html)

    USAGE:  mount <PATH_TO_IMAGE>       // mounts disk to next available letter
            umount                      //unmounts all mounted image files

[SHSUFDRV] - Virtual Floppy Device Manager
------------------------------------------

    Mounts a floppy disk image (IMG) to next available drive letter. The alias 
    FMOUNT is used on this system, thoguh the standard SHSUFDRV utilities are 
    installed (see http://adoxa.altervista.org/shsufdrv/index.html)

    USAGE: fmount /F:<PATH_TO_IMG>      // mounts disk to next available letter
           fmount /u                    // unmounts all mounted disk images

[USBASPI] - Universal USB Drivers for DOS
-----------------------------------------

    Installed to CONFIG.SYS. Scans USB controllers on boot, and mounts any 
    detected FAT32 USB Mass Storage devices. Can be picky about drives. 
    MBR only, FAT16 or FAT32 only. Anecdotally, it's best to have your 
    drive freshly formatted on a Windows machine 
    (Linux partition + format tools don't always work). 

    IT IS SERIOUSLY PICKY ABOUT DRIVES. NOTHING I CAN DO. KEEP TRYING TO 
    REFORMAT/KEEP PARTITIONS UNDER 2GB/ETC. USB CD DRIVES WORK *SOMETIMES*

[PKZIP / PKUNZIP] - ZIP Codec
-----------------------------

    Classic and self-explanatory. Baked right in. 

[RAMDRIVE] - RAM Disk Installation
----------------------------------

    Can be used to install contents of the floppy to RAM, to free up the drive
    for another disk. I haven't automated this process yet. It will require 
    modifying CONFIG.SYS. File is included, but you're on your own to find 
    instructions online at the moment. 

[VC] - Volkov Commander
-----------------------

    Includes Volkov Commander, the excellent two-pane file manager for DOS. Invoke it with 

        vc

[CHKDSK] - DOS Disk Check Utility
[SCANDISK] - Windows 95 Disk Check Utility
[FORMAT] - Disk Format Utility
[FDISK] - Disk Partition Utility
[XCOPY] - Bulk Copy / Backup Utility
----------------------------

    Classic DOS Disk Utilities, included. 

[EDIT.COM] - Text Editor
------------------------

    Classic DOS text editor, included.
